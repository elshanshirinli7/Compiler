# Go Compiler in Java

The Go Compiler in Java project is a basic Go compiler implemented in Java. It consists of four main classes: `TokenType`, `Token`, `Lexer`, and `Parser`. This project aims to provide a simplified implementation of a compiler for the Go programming language.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following classes:

- `TokenType`: This enum class defines the different types of tokens that can be encountered during the compilation process. Each token type corresponds to a specific language construct in Go, such as keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators.

- `Token`: The `Token` class represents a single token in the Go source code. It encapsulates the token type and its corresponding value.

- `Lexer`: The `Lexer` class is responsible for tokenizing the input Go source code. It takes the source code as input and produces a stream of tokens by scanning the source code character by character.

- `Parser`: The `Parser` class parses the tokens generated by the `Lexer` and performs syntactic analysis of the Go source code. It constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the structure of the code and checks for syntax errors.

## Usage

To use the Go Compiler in Java, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-compiler-java.git`
2. Import the project into your preferred Java development environment.
3. Use the provided classes (`TokenType`, `Token`, `Lexer`, `Parser`) in your own Java code or extend the functionality as needed.
4. Compile and run your Java program that utilizes the Go Compiler classes.

## Contribution Guidelines
